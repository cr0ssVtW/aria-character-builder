Legends of Aria Web Character Builder

This is a work in progress -- I just needed to upload it to get it out there as a backup.

This was a challenge to myself to create a character builder for Legends of Aria using purely PHP for backend calculations and display.
This could be more easily accomplished using Javascript and some HTML5 canvas stuff, but I want to see if its feasible to do this purely
on the backend. I MAY cave in do some async javascript stuff for single page things. We'll see.

TODO: 
- Finish basic stat/skill deduction/tracking and display. 
- Add hit/miss/damage/resist calculations for stats/skills in display using LoA algo's
- ??
